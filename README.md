Snake7 is a take on the classic Snake game! Guide your growing snake around the screen to eat apples before the computer (purple snake) does, and avoid hitting the walls or your own tail. With each apple you eat, your snake grows longer, making the game more challenging. Once you get to 7 links long, you win.
